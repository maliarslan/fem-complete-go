# Complete Go Course

This is a code repository for a workout tracking API project built in the [Complete Go](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-go) course on Frontend Masters.

## Setup

The API project is built from scratch. Before watching the course, you should install:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.24.2 or higher)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and any DB tool like psql or Sequel Ace to run SQL queries.
- [Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/)

It also requires a data migration tool and `goose` is used here
